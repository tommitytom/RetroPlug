With the current setup, compiling csspp should be done from within the
snapcpp environment or using the standalone tarball (see dev/INSTALL.md
for details about that other option).

The csspp project is also available pre-compiled on launchpad, which is
probably you best/easiest option if you have Ubuntu or some other Debian
flavor system.
