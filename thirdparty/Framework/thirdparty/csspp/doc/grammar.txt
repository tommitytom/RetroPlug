The grammar.txt file describes all the different commands understood by
CSS and our extensions. We clearly label what is what. Especially, we
offer cascading of rules which CSS does not offer by default.

### charset ###
###############

If the character set is defined and is not set to UTF-8, we generate error.
We only support UTF-8 for all input documents. If your document uses another
encoding, you need to convert that document before sending it to csspp.

  charset: '@' "charset" '"' [\x00-\x21\x23-\x7F] '"' ';'


Declare a namespace which gives you the ability to define a way to
write "<namespace>|<element>" instead of just "<element>". The string
represents a URI just like an xmlns definition in HTML.

  namespace: '@' "namespace" IDENT-TOKEN ( STRING-TOKEN | URL-TOKEN ) ';'
