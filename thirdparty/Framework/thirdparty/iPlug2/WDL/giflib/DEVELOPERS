Things to tell developers of libungif....

=======
Build Tools:
libungif presently uses autoconf, automake, and libtool in order to build
shared libraries for a wide variety of platforms.  The distributed tarball has
files prebuilt from these tools.  The cvs repository does not.  If you want to
build libungif you will need to have these tools available.  I currently run
with the following versions:
autoconf 2.57
automake 1.7.8
libtool 1.5

(P.S. I use the autogen.sh script in the top level directory to generate
configure, Makefile.in, etc using these tools.)

=======
cvs:
I currently do my work in a subversion repository.  Since sourceforge is still
using cvs and not subversion, there's nothing in the sourceforge tree.

If someone else wants to do development we can definitely talk about the best
way to share version control access.

=======
I create the distribution tar ball by using the `make dist` command.... After
hacking all I want, I check my sources into cvs, checkout a clean tree, run
./autogen.sh; make dist and then attempt to compile from the libungif-*.tar.gz
file that is generated.
